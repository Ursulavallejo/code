// Functions

/*A function is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task.*/

//We can calculate the area of one rectangle with the following code:

const width = 10;
const height = 6;
const area =  width * height;
console.log(area); // Output: 60

//Imagine being asked to calculate the area of three different rectangles:

const width1 = 10;
const height1 = 6;
const area1 =  width1 * height1;
console.log(area1)
// Area of the second rectangle
const width2 = 4;
const height2 = 9;
const area2 =  width2 * height2;
console.log(area2)
// Area of the third rectangle
const width3 = 10;
const height3 = 10;
const area3 =  width3 * height3;
console.log(area3)
