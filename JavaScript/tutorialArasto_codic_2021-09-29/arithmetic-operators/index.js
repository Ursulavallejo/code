/*
The remainder operator, sometimes called modulo, returns the number that remains after 
the right-hand number divides into the left-hand number as many times as it evenly can: 
11 % 3 equals 2 because 3 fits into 11 three times, leaving 2 as the remainder.*/
/*
An operator is a character that performs a task in our code. JavaScript has several built-in 
arithmetic operators, that allow us to perform mathematical calculations on numbers. 
These include the following operators and their corresponding symbols:

Add: +
Subtract: -
Multiply: *
Divide: /
Remainder: %
